# Creating a Travel [Journal](https://eric-metcalf.github.io/pct-map-website/) for the Pacific Crest Trail

I have spent a bunch of time thinking about how I want to share my experience of the pct and have found it
very interesting to see what peaks peoples interest. I have done slide shows, answered several questions and played with a few different formats.
First they are excited to hear about why i hiked it, and then have a standard set of responses set of questions they ask. 

* how many shoes did you go through?
* did you hike the whole thing?
* i could never do something like that
* congrats!

I am really tempted from this point on, to try and keep track of the different questions that people ask. But i digress. 

The main point, people are interested in my adventure and will say that it is a trip of a lifetime and I agree. I want to cherish it and find ways relive the 
experience. Here enters the travel journal.

But when it boils down to, there are a few things that I am not the best at, and one is writing, (as i sit here and write this post) 

I still wanted a way to track and remember the trip without having to sit down and write about every single experience. So this is where I started thinking
about putting together a different type of travel journal: One that allows me to remember the things along the trip, while being able to share the experience
with others, and not having to write a bunch of mediocre blog posts. Enter my friend: Data. 

### A little bit of background

So when you venture out on a trip like this, it is really important to let the people in your life that you are safe. Goal number one of the
hike should be to not die, and shortly followed by not driving your mother crazy by thinking that you are not safe and that you have gone missing. 
So insert solution 1, text my family using a satellite communicator that I am alive before I go to bed every single night. 
Highly recommend this, worked really well, till i lost my spoon. (story for another day)

After investigating this garmin inReach more, I noticed it had the ability to allow you to send your location along with the text.  Sending these messages would allow me to KNOW ALL THE PLACES I HAVE CAMPED ALONG THE TRAIL! booooya. 
Being the software engineer I am, I started making standard formats for each message, and knew at the end of the trail I wanted to put all of them on one map, to be a cool illustration of where i stayed along the trail.

After a day of hacking and figuring out how to parse json files of the text message dumps i was able to put together this website that has the information.
I am going to be building it out more but thought i would just write this up to share the idea!

Here is the first pass on the [Journal](https://eric-metcalf.github.io/pct-map-website/).

### Time To Pun
I think it is time to ad-journ-al from this post and travel on to the next task. Signing off.
