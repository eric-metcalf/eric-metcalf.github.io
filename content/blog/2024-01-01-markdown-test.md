# Markdown Formatting Test

This post demonstrates all the markdown features supported by the blog system.

## Headers

Headers work from H1 to H6 and have proper spacing.

### This is an H3

#### This is an H4

Regular paragraph text follows headers with appropriate spacing.

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

Here's a simple bullet list:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item with more text to show how wrapping works

### Nested Lists

You can also nest lists:

- Top level item
  - Nested item 1
  - Nested item 2
- Another top level item
  - More nested content

### Ordered Lists

1. First numbered item
2. Second numbered item
3. Third numbered item
4. Fourth numbered item

## Text Formatting

You can use **bold text** and *italic text* or even ***bold and italic together***.

You can also use `inline code` for technical terms.

## Links

Here's a [link to Google](https://google.com) and another [link to GitHub](https://github.com).

## Code Blocks

Here's a code block:

```
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
  return true;
}
```

## Spacing

Paragraphs are properly spaced.

This is a new paragraph with proper spacing above and below.

And another paragraph to demonstrate consistent spacing throughout the document.

## Horizontal Rules

You can add horizontal rules to separate sections:

## Mixed Content

Here's a paragraph followed by a list:

Some introductory text about the list below.

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

And then more paragraph text after the list.

### Another List Example

Here are some things I like:

- Coffee in the morning
- Long walks in nature
- Reading good books
- Writing code
- Taking photographs

Each item has proper spacing and formatting.

## Conclusion

This demonstrates that the markdown parser now properly handles:

1. Multiple types of lists (ordered and unordered)
2. Proper spacing between elements
3. Nested content
4. Code blocks and inline code
5. Text formatting (bold, italic)
6. Links
7. Headers at all levels
8. Horizontal rules

Everything should render beautifully with proper spacing and formatting!
