# Announcing Ramblings of Eric Metcalf aka Dori

Hello all, I am realizing that I have wanted to start and put together a blog for a long time now but have not really done anything to start that process. Who knows if anybody is going to start reading this, but I guess, we will start finding out. These are going to be several topics I will cover. 

* my escapades back into software engineering
* pct and through hiking
* cooking
* who else knows

All I know is that I am excited to see where this journey takes me and hope people will enjoy the ride.

### Obligatory Pun

Not sure, I have one of these, but it might im pretty sure it is just writers blog-k.
