# Creating a Travel Journal for the Pacific Crest Trail

I have spent a bunch of time thinking about how i want to share my experience of the pct and have found it
very intersting to see what everybody is intersted. First they are excited to hear about why i hiked it, and then have a standard
set of questions they ask. I am really tempted from this point on, to try and keep track of the different questions that people ask.
But when it boils down to, there are a few things that i see with the travel journal are important. One they share the experience with
others, and allows me to reconnect with my adventure. As somebody that does not like to write, I went into the trip thinking about other
ways i could connect instead doing the traditional writing in a book. I went out of my way to use technology to help me create some sort
journal, and achieve the same results. I am in the process of building it but I thought i would share it as a start.

## A little bit of background

So when you venture out on a trip like this, it is really important to let the people in your life that you are safe. Goal number one of the
hike should be to not drive your mother crazy by thinking that you are not safe and that you have gone missing. So insert strategy 1 of things
i was already going to do, but could be used as a tool to remeber the hike! THE GARMIN IN REACH, (mini 2 if people are really curious on the exact model)
This allowed me to send text messages to my family to tell them that i was alive! after playing with the device a little more, i saw something that was
even better! IT HAD the ability to allow you to send your location along with the text. I then decided that I could secretly be telling everyone in my
family that i am safe but, then KNOW ALL THE PLACES I HAVE CAMPED ALONG THE TRAIL! booooya, easy way to build a travel journal with little to no effort.
Bein the software engineer i am, I started making standard formats and new at the end of the trail I wanted to put all of them on one map, to be a cool
illustration of what i did along the trail.

After a day of haking and figuring out how to parse json files of the text message dumps i was able to put together this website that has the information.
I am going to be building it out more but thought i would just write this up to share the idea!

Hope you enjoy and I will be back when i put up some additional updates.

### Time To Pun
